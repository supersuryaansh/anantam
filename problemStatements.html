                <p>
                  Communication gap among management, employees, and clients.
                  The management lacks awareness of ground-level processes,
                  while simultaneously remaining unaware of the issues faced by
                  employees and clients. Conversely, employees and clients may
                  experience difficulty in communicating their problems, and the
                  management is unaware of the effectiveness of employee
                  performance or client satisfaction. This creates ambiguity
                  regarding whether the company or institute is successfully
                  fulfilling its vision and mission.
